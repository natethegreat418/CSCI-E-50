# CSCI-E-50
The majority (excluding tests/quizes for which I don't have the questions) of my work from Intensive Intro to Comp Sci from HarvardExtension Spring2017


## Contents:
*Pset1: intro to C, loops/while </br>
*Pset2: en/de-cryption in C, command line arguments </br>
*Pset3: Game of 15 in C, I had to implement the following functions:  init (initial board setup), draw (recreation of the board after moves), move (allows tiles to be re-arranged by user - given rules), won (indicates if the game is won and should be terminated) </br>
*Pset4: Forensic discovery in C (basically manipulating and modifying image file meta data) - I never figured out how to get the image resizer working </br>
*Pset6: Intro to Python, basic sentiment analysis of twitter feeds, rework of Pset1/2 from C into Python </br>
*Pset7: Working with Flask/Django to create python power web application: applciation allows user to "buy/sell" stocks, prices fetched from Yahoo (helpers.py was supplied to me by course for project) </br>
*Pset8: Further adventures in dynamic web applications using Python frameworks: application pulls news articles onto a map based on given location, employs various Google apis (helpers.py was supplied to me by course for project) </br>
*Finalp: Course capstone. Attempted to make a "Facebook-esque" dynamic application using Flask/Django that allowed you to find friends, choose activites that interested you and schedule the friend for that activity. Didn't get it working exactly as I imagined, but proud of the date/time handling and the view AJAX calls (thanks BLind for the assist) </br>
